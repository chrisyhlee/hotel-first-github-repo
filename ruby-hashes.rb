    # Challenges

# As a developer, I can create a hash called my_phone using the Ruby method .new.
    my_phone = Hash.new

# As a developer, I can add five key:value pairs of app names and their descriptions to my hash.

    my_phone[:my_fitness_pal] = 'track food you eat throughout each day'
    p my_phone

# As a developer, I can return a value from my_phone by passing in the name of a key.
# As a developer, I can update two keys in my_phone.
# As a developer, I can update two values in my_phone.
# As a developer, I can delete two key:value pairs from my_phone.
# As a developer, I can use an enumerable method to return information about all of my_phone's applications.
